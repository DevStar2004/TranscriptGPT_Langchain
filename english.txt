00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,051
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

2
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,477
Oh, my God.

3
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,397
Oh, my... Excuse me. Move, move,
move! Emergency, please!

4
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,024
Excuse me, excuse me.

5
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,908
- Rach!
- Ah!

6
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,534
There you are!

7
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,620
Hey!
- Hi!

8
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,831
Oh! So, so.

9
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,793
How was China? You!

10
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,338
It was... It was great.
Oh, what happened?

11
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,256
- What? I am?
- You're bleeding.

12
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,050
- God.
- Oh, look at that! Yes, I am. Heh.

13
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,303
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

14
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,140
Come on, I wanna hear everything.
Everything!

15
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,103
Well, uh, where do I start? Um...

16
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,440
This is Julie.
Uh, Julie, this is Rachel.

17
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,276
Hi. Heh.

18
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,487
Uh, oh! These are...

19
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,281
- These are... Aren't for you.
- Oh.

20
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,284
Heh. Uh, these are for you.

21
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,329
Welcome to our country.

22
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,709
Thank you. I'm from New York.

23
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,715
Well, not a problem.
We'll use them to stop the bleeding.

24
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,844
Okay. Uh, baggage claim?

25
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,512
- Okay.
- Okay.

26
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,478
- No way.
- I'm telling you, she went to the airport.

27
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,438
And she's gonna go for it with Ross.

28
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:32,651
Oh, my God. This is huge. This...

29
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,070
This is bigger than huge.
This is...

30
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,322
All right, what's bigger than huge?

31
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,868
- Um, this?
- Yes.

32
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,453
Guys, you got new haircuts!

33
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,789
Yes, yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,750
Because, you know:

35
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,253
"If you don't
look good, we don't look good. "

36
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,505
I love that voice! Ha, ha.

37
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,508
- You guys!
- Oh, oh.

38
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,094
Airport. Airport. Ross.

39
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,762
Not... Not alone.

40
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,057
Julie. Arm around her!

41
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,895
Unh! Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

42
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,689
Okay, I think she's trying
to tell us something.

43
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,025
Quick, get the verbs.

44
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,444
- Ow.
- You! You!

45
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,112
You said he liked me!

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,822
You! You...!

47
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,450
You slowpokes!

48
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,494
That's all right, Rach.
We got the bags. Uh...

49
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,580
Hi. Hello.

50
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,792
Julie, this is my sister, Monica.
This is Chandler.

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,878
- Hey.
- Phoebe, hi. Mwah.

52
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,963
- Joey, what up?
- Hey.

53
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,717
- Everyone, this is Julie.
- Julie.

54
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,178
Oh.

55
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,932
Hi!

56
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,184
Hi! But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

57
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,896
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

58
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,065
- And bus.
- Oh, my God!

59
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,442
- With the screaming guy...
- And the spitting.

60
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,736
You gotta hear this story.

61
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,030
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

62
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,865
Two hundred, at least.

63
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,494
- And this guy...
- And the chicken poops in her lap! Ha!

64
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,834
Oh, I'm so sorry.

65
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,212
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

66
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,673
Ugh, I just heard this story in the cab...

67
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,677
...and it is all I can think about.

68
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,807
This is amazing. I mean, how...?

69
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,060
- How did this happen?
- Ross and I were in grad school together.  

70
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,480
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

71
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,942
...guess who's in charge of the dig?
- Julie!

72
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,987
Julie. Isn't that great?

73
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:45,200
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

74
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,329
It's an expression.

75
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,207
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

76
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,960
- Then we're gonna go see the baby.
- Then get some sleep.

77
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,546
Yeah, it's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

78
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,840
Well don't tell us
what's gonna happen, though

79
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,800
Because I like to be surprised.

80
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,723
Bye!
Bye.

81
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,485
- Rach. Can I get some coffee? Thank you.
- Sure.

82
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,362
- Hey, Rach...
- Did you talk to him yet?

83
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,448
- No.
- Then, no.

84
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,338
So, what the hell happened
to you in China?

85
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,674
I mean, when last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

86
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,093
I know. I know I was.

87
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,929
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

88
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:52,184
"It's never gonna happen. Move on. "
You know whose voice that was?

89
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,269
God?

90
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,855
It was you, pal.

91
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,691
Well, maybe it was God doing me.

92
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,113
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

93
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,991
And then I met Julie, and...

94
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,993
I don't know. We're having a great time.

95
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:14,456
I never would have gone for it with her,
if it hadn't been for you.

96
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,293
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

97
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,421
- Here's your lemonade.
- I didn't order lemonade.

98
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,508
Oh. Well then you better go
take that back.

99
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,259
They're gonna charge you for that.

100
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,929
- But...
- Go, go, go! Come on, come on!
